## Files Overview

### Manifest File (`manifest.json`)

Defines the extension's metadata and permissions, including:
- `activeTab` and `tabs` permissions for interacting with the current tab.
- Host permissions for `ankiuser.net` and `jpdb.io`.

### Background Script (`background.js`)

Handles messages from the content script and ensures efficient jpdb.io integration:
- Opens or reloads a jpdb.io tab with the specified kanji/word content.

### Content Script (`contentScript.js`)

Processes the DOM on AnkiWeb:
- Extracts kanji and furigana from `<ruby>` tags.
- Adds a clickable link to jpdb.io and a copy button.
- Implements a spacebar shortcut to flip cards and open jpdb.io.

---

## Permissions

- `activeTab`: Allows interaction with the currently active tab.
- `tabs`: Enables querying and updating existing tabs.
- `host_permissions`: Grants access to:
  - `ankiuser.net/study/*` for interacting with AnkiWeb.
  - `jpdb.io/*` for kanji/word lookups.

---

## How It Works

1. The **Content Script** processes AnkiWeb's DOM to:
   - Add clickable links and copy buttons.
   - Detect and process `<ruby>` tags for kanji/furigana pairs.
   - Monitor card flips and dynamically update the content.

2. The **Background Script**:
   - Ensures that jpdb.io opens in an existing tab or creates a new one.
   - Reloads the jpdb.io tab with the current card's content.

3. The **Spacebar Shortcut**:
   - Triggers both the jpdb.io lookup and the card flip for a seamless study workflow.

## Development

### Requirements
- Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).
- Basic knowledge of Chrome extensions.

### Steps to Modify
1. Edit the `contentScript.js` or `background.js` file as needed.
2. Reload the extension via `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Test changes on AnkiWeb (`ankiuser.net/study/*`).

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension Not Working**:
  - Ensure the extension is loaded and active via `chrome://extensions/`.
  - Verify that you're on a supported page (`ankiuser.net/study/*`).
- **jpdb.io Not Opening**:
  - Check if `jpdb.io` permissions are granted in the manifest file.
  - Make sure the URL matches `https://jpdb.io/`.
